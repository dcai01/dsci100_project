    "Tennis is a popular sport among men and women all over the world. Therefore, the analysis of factors affecting performance and success is of great interest. Since tennis players' earnings can vary widely and \"Prize Money” could reflect a player's earnings in tennis tournaments, understanding the determinants of prize money can provide insights into the financial success of professional tennis players. One main factor is ranking points. In professional tennis, players compete in various tournaments, accumulate ranking points, and move up or down in the rankings based on their performance. This system is used to determine tournament entries and player recognition. In our model, our research question is \"How can we use ranking points to predict the prize money a tennis player receives?\" To answer the question, we will be using the data `player_stats(1).csv` from Ultimate Tennis Statistics. This data set contains the statistics of the top 500 tennis players in the world."
