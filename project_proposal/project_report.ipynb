    "Tennis is a popular sport among men and women all over the world. Therefore, the analysis of factors affecting performance and success is of great interest. Since tennis players' earnings can vary widely and \"Prize Money” could reflect a player's earnings in tennis tournaments, understanding the determinants of prize money can provide insights into the financial success of professional tennis players. One main factor is ranking points. In professional tennis, players compete in various tournaments, accumulate ranking points, and move up or down in the rankings based on their performance. This system is used to determine tournament entries and player recognition. In our model, our research question is \"How can we use ranking points to predict the prize money a tennis player receives?\" To answer the question, we will be using the data `player_stats(1).csv` from Ultimate Tennis Statistics. This data set contains the statistics of the top 500 tennis players in the world.\n",

    "We use data from Ultimate Tennis Statistics, which is based on the open-source tennis data repository by Jeff Sackmann with some corrections and additions for incorrect or missing data. This database provides users with a variety of tennis statistics for men's tennis during the Open period, such as historical results, in-match statistics, records or all-time greats comparisons. The extensive nature of the dataset makes it a valuable resource for conducting in-depth analyses and deriving insights into various facets of men's tennis during the specified Open period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original dataset contains 500 rows and 38 columns with 500 tennis players and 37 factors of interest. We have wrangled and cleaned the dataset so that we can focus only on the variables we want to explore. We have also removed all the \"NA\" values. The wrangled dataset contains 407 rows and 9 columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our dependent variable is a player's earnings in tennis tournaments which is represented by `prize_money` in our model (Unit: US dollar). Since prize money is a visual reflection of tennis players' income in the game, we set prize money as the independent variable. We predict the prize money income of professional tennis players in the subsequent data analysis to understand their economic success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main independent variable are `best_rank` and `current_rank`; `best_rank` represents a player's the highest rank they have achieved. This variable can impact a player's reputation, endorsements, and invitations to play in future prestige tournaments. `current_rank` represents a tennis player's current rank. By analyzing the current ranks of players, it allows us to analyze how their ranking point may affect their progress; having a higher current rank will allow tennis players an opportunity to enter more honored tournaments, which will impact the amount of prize money they will earn. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our control variables are `age`, `dominant_dummy` (their playing hand), and `backhand_dummy` (the use of backhand plays). \n",
    "`age` is important since younger players may have more energy and stamina, potentially providing them with a competitive advantage. On the other hand, older players may have the experience and strategic depth, but their physical condition may decline. Dominant hand and the choice of backhand style can impact a player's style and game strategy, which might be reflected in their prize earnings. We transformed the qualitative variables to its respective dummy variables, 1 is for right handed while 0 is for left handed. All of these variables provide different dimensions of a player's career and can help create a more accurate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have conducted a summary statistics table. For the \"Variable\" column, it lists the names or labels of the variables or features in our dataset. \n",
    "For the \"Mean\" column, it displays the average value of each variable. The mean is a measure of central tendency, representing the central or typical value in our dataset.\n",
    "For the \"Max\" column, it shows the maximum value observed for each variable. This value represents the highest point or measurement in the dataset for a particular variable. It helps identify the upper limit or extreme values within the dataset.\n",
    "For the \"Min\" column, it shows the minimum value observed for each variable. This value represents the lowest point or measurement in the dataset for a particular variable. It helps identify the lowest limit or extreme values within the dataset.\n",

The distribution of the variance in prizes is larger for left-handed players than for right-handed players. The top 25% of left-handed player have relatively higher prize money, even though right-handed group tends to have more possibile outliers. A research paper states that over a 32-year period, left-handed male and female professional tennis singles players were significantly over-represented among successful athletes, which means that left-handed people are likely to be more talented in tennis than right-handed people (Holtzen, 2000).The results we reached are consistent with the conclusions in this paper.

    "## Discussion:\n",
    "Our findings indicate that the best ranking points has the postive impact on increasing prize money (since smaller ranking points represent higher rankings, the positive coefficient means that the higher ranking points, the higher the prize money, and the lower ranking points, the lower the prize money). For each lower ranking, the prize money increases by $210,345.6. The current ranking points has the negative impact on increasing prize money (since smaller ranking points represent higher rankings, the negative coefficient means that the lower ranking points, the higher the prize money, and the higher ranking points, the lower the prize money). For each higher ranking, the prize money increases by $793,521.2. A paper that examines the relationship between tennis rankings and prize money states that in 2017, the top 100 tennis players in the rankings received about 90 % of the total prize money on the tour that year, and inequality is also evident in the top 100, with the top 20 players earning more than 55  of all prize money, while the bottom half of the top 100 received less than one-fifth of the prize money of the top 100 (JEANGOUT, 2017). The positive relation between best rank and price money from our linear regression model is consistent with the conclusion that the higher the rank in the paper, the more price money it takes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expected that our main independet variable current ranking points and best ranking points would have negative correlation with prize money (since smaller ranking points represent higher rankings, the negative coefficient means that the smaller ranking points, the higher the prize money) . However, the results of best ranking points the results of the best ranking points were not what we expected. We guess this is due to the fact that we are using a linear regression model and the dataset is not fitted enough. From Figure 2 we can see that the relationship between current rank and prize money is non-linear correlation, so in the future maybe we should use a more accurate regression model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also conclude that age has the postive impact on increasing prize money. For each additional year of age, the prize money increases by $15,935,143.5.  For dominant hands, our results show that right-handed players will have an additional $151,159,217.6 in prize money. For backhand use, our results show that one-handed players will have an additional $415,900,163.0 in prize money.\n",
